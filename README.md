# Student Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes **student performance data** to uncover insights about factors influencing academic success.  
It applies **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models** to predict students' performance.  

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Correlation analysis between features and performance  
- Machine learning models for prediction (Regression / Classification)  
- Interactive plots and performance metrics  

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook
