# Student Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes **student performance data** to uncover insights about factors influencing academic success.  
It applies **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models** to predict students' performance.  

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Correlation analysis between features and performance
- Machine learning models for prediction (Regression / Classification)
- Interactive plots and performance metrics

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
